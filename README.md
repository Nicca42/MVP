Memes Videos Photos - Decentralized social media, where the creators own their content and users can view content add free.  

How to set MVP up: 

What MVP doese:
    MVp is a social media platform much like YouTube or Instagram, but instead of covering server costs with invasive adds, users buy the ability to view content. 
    Views are cheap and affordable, and it will not cost the user much to buy enough Views to consume content. The Views are transefered to the contents creator. 
    1 Eth = 100 000 Views, making each View aproximatly (and at the time of writing) worth 4c. This makes it affordable for the user and profitable for the creator.
